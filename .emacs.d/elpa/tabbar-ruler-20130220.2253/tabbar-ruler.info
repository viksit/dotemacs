1.1 Introduction
================

Tabbar ruler is an emacs package that allows both the tabbar and the
ruler to be used together. In addition it allows auto-hiding of the
menu-bar and tool-bar.

Tabbar appearance based on reverse engineering Aquaemacs code and
changing to my preferences, and Emacs Wiki.

Tabbar/Ruler integration is new. Tabbar should be active on mouse move.
Ruler should be active on self-insert commands.

Also allows auto-hiding of toolbar and menu.

To use this, put the library in your load path and use

(setq tabbar-ruler-global-tabbar 't) ; If you want tabbar (setq
tabbar-ruler-global-ruler 't) ; if you want a global ruler (setq
tabbar-ruler-popup-menu 't) ; If you want a popup menu. (setq
tabbar-ruler-popup-toolbar 't) ; If you want a popup toolbar

(require 'tabbar-ruler)

1.2 Known issues
================

the left arrow is text instead of an image. ## History

   * *20-Feb-2013* - Changed so that the separators do not need to be
     fancy images. I found that when the separators were images, it
     slowed down emacs on windows. Therefore, the fancy images are
     disabled by default. This also includes the stylized close
     symbols. (Matthew L. Fidler)

   * *19-Dec-2012* - Added back popup-menu (Matthew L. Fidler)

   * *19-Dec-2012* - Upload to marmalade (Matthew L. Fidler)

   * *19-Dec-2012* - Changed slope. Made the background color the
     default background color if unspecified. Made tabbar-hex-color
     return "None" if not defined (Matthew L. Fidler)

   * *15-Dec-2012* - Made sure that the tabbr-ruler-separator-image is
     at least 17 pixels high (Matthew L. Fidler)

   * *15-Dec-2012* - Attempt to fix another bug on load (Matthew L.
     Fidler)

   * *14-Dec-2012* - Fixed tabbar ruler so that it loads cold. (Matthew
     L. Fidler)

   * *14-Dec-2012* - Memoized the tabbar images to speed things up
     (Matthew L. Fidler)

   * *14-Dec-2012* - Upload to Marmalade (Mat"thew L. Fidler)

   * *14-Dec-2012* - Fancy tabs (Matthew L. Fidler)

   * *13-Dec-2012* - Added Bug fix for coloring. Made the selected tab
     match the default color in the buffer. Everything else is grayed
     out. (Matthew L. Fidler)

   * *10-Dec-2012* - Took out a statement that may fix the
     left-scrolling bug? (Matthew L. Fidler)

   * *10-Dec-2012* - Added package-menu-mode to the excluded
     tabbar-ruler fight modes. (Matthew L. Fidler)

   * *07-Dec-2012* - Will no longer take over editing of org source
     blocks or info blocks. (Matthew L. Fidler)

   * *07-Dec-2012* - Changed the order of checking so that helm will
     work when you move a mouse. (Matthew L. Fidler)

   * *07-Dec-2012* - Now works with Helm. Should fix issue #1 (Matthew
     L. Fidler)

   * *06-Dec-2012* - Now colors are based on loaded theme (from
     minibar). Also added bug-fix for setting tabbar colors every time
     a frame opens. Also added a bug fix for right-clicking a frame
     that is not associated with a buffer. 1-Mar-2012 Matthew L. Fidler
     Last-Updated: Thu Mar 1 08:38:09 2012 (-0600) #656 (Matthew L.
     Fidler) Will not change tool-bar-mode in Mac. It causes some funny
     things to happen. 9-Feb-2012 Matthew L. Fidler Last-Updated: Thu
     Feb 9 19:18:21 2012 (-0600) #651 (Matthew L. Fidler) Will not
     change the menu bar in a Mac. Its always there. (Matthew L. Fidler)

   * *14-Jan-2012* - Added more commands that trigger the ruler.
     (Matthew L. Fidler)

   * *14-Jan-2012* - Added more ruler commands. It works a bit better
     now. Additionally I have changed the ep- to tabbar-ruler-.

     the last known mouse position. This fixes the two problems below.
     (us041375)

   * *20-Oct-2010* - As it turns out when the toolbar is hidden when
     the mouse is outside of the emacs window, it also hides when
     navigating the menu. Switching behavior back. (us041375)

   * *20-Oct-2010* - Made popup menu and toolbar be hidden when mouse
     is oustide of emacs window. (us041375)
